/**
 * Mount MCP Inspector UI at /inspector
 *
 * Dynamically loads and mounts the MCP Inspector UI package if available, providing
 * a web-based interface for testing and debugging MCP servers. The inspector
 * automatically connects to the local MCP server endpoints.
 *
 * This function gracefully handles cases where the inspector package is not installed,
 * allowing the server to function without the inspector in production environments.
 *
 * @param app - Hono app instance
 * @param serverHost - Server hostname
 * @param serverPort - Server port
 * @param isProduction - Whether the server is running in production mode
 * @returns Promise that resolves to true if inspector was mounted, false otherwise
 *
 * @example
 * If @mcp-use/inspector is installed:
 * - Inspector UI available at http://localhost:PORT/inspector
 * - Automatically connects to http://localhost:PORT/mcp (or /sse)
 *
 * If not installed:
 * - Server continues to function normally
 * - No inspector UI available
