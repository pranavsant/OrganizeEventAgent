/**
 * MCP-UI to MCP Apps Adapter Runtime
 *
 * This module enables existing MCP-UI apps to run in new MCP Apps SEP environments
 * by intercepting MCP-UI protocol messages and translating them to JSON-RPC over postMessage.
 *
 * Note: This file is bundled as a standalone script injected into HTML.
 * Types are imported from @modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps for compile-time safety only.
 * All runtime values (like LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION) must be defined locally to avoid
 * bundling the entire ext-apps package into the output.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps
